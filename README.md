# Simple Hash-Based Information Tracker aka SHIT

SHIT is a git like toolkit for a version control system. It is fundamentally a content addressable system. As of current development status, it doesn't support VCS but it is in dev pipeline.

## Plumbing

The current version of SHIT is built solely upon, what is referred to in git terminology as plumbing commands. They are low-level subcommands that can be chained together in UNIX-style or called from scripts.

## Porcelain

In development. To be added soon
